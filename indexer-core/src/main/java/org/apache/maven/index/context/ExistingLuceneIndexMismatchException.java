/**
 * Thrown when a user tries to create a NexusInder IndexingContext over and existing Lucene index, and there is a
 * mismatch. The reason for mismatch may be multiple: non-NexusIndexer Lucene index (basically missing the descriptor
 * document), index version is wrong or unknown, repositoryId from context and descriptor document does not matches,
 * etc. This exception is not thrown in cases when "reclaim" is done, as in those cases, even if an unknown index is
 * found, descriptor will be forcefully added with current context information, potentially replacing the existing
 * descriptor, if any.
